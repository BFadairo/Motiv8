# Onramp Android Take Home Project 

## Overview ðŸ¤–

This repository serves as a starting point for Onramp Apprenticeship candidates who are completing the Android take home project. This project has the purpose of providing the Onramp recruiting team with a better understanding of your experience with Java programming and Android development. 

## Description ðŸš€

{Insert Description}

## Important Details ðŸ”Ž

#### Submission Format

Each candidate should fork the [onramp-android-take-home](https://github.com/onramp-io/onramp-android-take-home) Github repository and commit to their master branch for the entire project. Note that this forked repository is what should ultimately be submitted once development has been completed. 

Each repository should include an updated README file which provides the follow:

*    A high level architectural overview of their Android application. e.g. names, relationships and purposes of all application components, including Activities, Services, Content Providers, Broadcast Receivers, etc. 
*   A brief description of any design patterns leveraged
*   Screenshots of each Activity View and descriptions of the overall user flow.


#### Submission Deadline 

The deadline for this project is March 22nd, 2019 at 11:59pm PST. A project submission is completed by emailing [engineering@onramp.io](mailto:engineering@onramp.io) with a link to the repository of the Android application. 

## Grading Rubric Criteria ðŸŒŸ

The overall strength and quality of an Android app submission will be determined by five factors. Detailed below are each of these areas of focus:

#### UI Design

Android users expect your application to look and behave in a way that's consistent intuitive. Your Android application should utilize thoughtful [animations](https://material.io/design/motion/), [patterns](https://material.io/design/), [style](https://material.io/design/color/), [components](https://material.io/design/components/) and [layouts](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html) to create a thoughtful and highly usable user interface/views.

#### Architecture Pattern

An architecture pattern enables you to define a guide for how a piece of software should function, such that it can be scalable, maintainable and testable. Common patterns for Android applications include [MVC](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-1-model-view-controller-3baecef5f2b6) (Model View Controller), [MVP](https://android.jlelse.eu/architectural-guidelines-to-follow-for-mvp-pattern-in-android-2374848a0157) (Model View Presenter) and [MVVM](https://medium.com/@husayn.hakeem/android-by-example-mvvm-data-binding-introduction-part-1-6a7a5f388bf7) (Model View ViewModel). It is strongly encouraged that you leverage one of these patterns within you Android app.

#### Core Android Components

[Activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities), [Services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services), [Broadcast Receivers](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html) and [Content Providers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html) are four types of Android Application components, which are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each type serves a distinct purpose and has a distinct lifecycle that defines how the component is created and destroyed. 

The usage of Activities and Services are extremely common when implementing Android apps and therefore **mandatory**, however, each application should strive to utilize atleast one example of both a Broadcast Receiver and Content Provider depending on the app design. 

#### Android Development Best Practices

It's important to subscribe to a set of best practices when designing and implementing an Android app. Being mindful of widely accepted principles like [DRY](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3-key-software-principles-you-must-understand--net-25161) (don't repeat yourself), maintain a [separation of concerns](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#separation-of-concerns) within your Android components and specifying good [project structure](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro) result in providing a high quality user experience which efficiently utilizes phone hardware resources available and ensures other developers can easily navigate through your code.

#### Android Application Description

As detailed above, each project submission should included a README file, which provides an overview of the Android application, detailing design decisions and overall architecture. Screenshots of the Android app taken from the Android Studio emulator are also required. This task assess the corporal competency of communicating and documenting 

*Note: Testing frameworks and strategies are intentionally NOT included within the rubric. Though UI and Android component testing are critical paractes of Android Development, this take home project prioritizes a focus on surfacing Java/Android development proficiency.
