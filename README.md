# Onramp Android Take Home Project 

## Overview ðŸ¤–

Congratulations for making it this far in the interview process for the Pandora Demo Tape Apprenticeship at Onramp. This project seeks to better inform the Onramp team of your experience with Java programming and Android development. 

You will have five business days to complete it, though it will likely only require ~24 hours worth of design, implementation and documentation to complete a submission (assuming a moderate level of Android and Java development experience).

## Description ðŸš€
Description coming soon!

## Important Details ðŸ”Ž

#### Researching and Plagiarism

You are actively encouraged to research the web, books, videos, or tutorials for this project. That said, we expect all code that is submitted to be your own (e.g. this project should **NOT** be completed with another person). That means that we expect each candidate to refrain from copying and/or pasting code into the project. If we find copied code in your project, you will not be invited to continue interviewing. 

#### Submission Format

This repository will be your starting point. Please fork this Github repository ([onramp-android-take-home](https://github.com/onramp-io/onramp-android-take-home)) and commit to your master branch for the project. Once the Android application has been completed, you'll be submitting this forked repository. Prior to submitting your project, you should update the README file to provide the following information:

*    A high level architectural overview of your Android application. e.g. names, relationships and purposes of all components, including Activities, Services, Content Providers, Broadcast Receivers, etc. 
*   A brief description of any design patterns that you leveraged.
*   Screenshots of each Activity View and descriptions of the overall user flow.

#### Submission Deadline + Process

You must submit your project by March 22nd, 2019 at 11:59pm PST. Your project will be considered complete when you email [submissions@onramp.io](mailto:engineering@onramp.io) with a link to your repository. 

## What we're looking for ðŸŒŸ

We will be evaluating your project by assessing the overall strength and quality of the following five factors: 

#### UI Design

Android users expect your application to look and behave in a way that's consistently intuitive. Your Android application should utilize thoughtful [animations](https://material.io/design/motion/), [patterns](https://material.io/design/), [style](https://material.io/design/color/), [components](https://material.io/design/components/) and [layouts](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html) to create a highly usable user interface.

#### Architecture Pattern

An architecture pattern enables you to define a guide for how a piece of software should function, such that it can be scalable, maintainable, and testable. Common patterns for Android applications include [MVC](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-1-model-view-controller-3baecef5f2b6) (Model View Controller), [MVP](https://android.jlelse.eu/architectural-guidelines-to-follow-for-mvp-pattern-in-android-2374848a0157) (Model View Presenter) and [MVVM](https://medium.com/@husayn.hakeem/android-by-example-mvvm-data-binding-introduction-part-1-6a7a5f388bf7) (Model View ViewModel). It is strongly encouraged that you leverage one of these patterns within your Android app.

#### Core Android Components

[Activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities), [Services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services), [Broadcast Receivers](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html), and [Content Providers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html) are four types of Android Application components, which are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each serves a distinct purpose and has a distinct lifecycle that defines how the component is created and destroyed. 

The usage of Activities and Services are extremely common when implementing Android apps and are therefore **mandatory** to include in your project, however, each application should strive to utilize at least one example of either a Broadcast Receiver and/or Content Provider depending on the app design. 

#### Android Development Best Practices

It's important to subscribe to a set of best practices when designing and implementing an Android app. Be mindful of these widely accepted principles:

*   [DRY](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3-key-software-principles-you-must-understand--net-25161) (don't repeat yourself)
*   Maintain a [separation of concerns](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#separation-of-concerns) within your Android components
*   Specify good [project structure](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro)

Using these principles will result in a high quality user experience while efficiently utilizing phone hardware resources and ensuring other developers can easily navigate through your code.

#### Android Application Description

As detailed above, each project submission should included a README file, which provides an overview of the Android application, detailing design decisions and overall architecture. Screenshots of the Android app taken from the Android Studio emulator are also required. This task assess the critical competency of communicating and documenting 

*Note: Testing frameworks and strategies are intentionally NOT included within the rubric. Though UI and Android component testing are critical paractes of Android Development, this take home project prioritizes a focus on surfacing Java/Android development proficiency.
